# Conversion UX Model - StagePilot

Updated: 2026-05-30

This note specializes the repository for service launch. It combines product strategy, UX design, behavioral economics, and neuroscience-informed attention and working-memory design in a practical way: reduce confusion, build trust, help the right user act, and avoid manipulative conversion patterns.

## Commercial Focus

| Field | Decision |
|---|---|
| Repository status | active |
| Lane | B2B developer tooling |
| Primary buyer or user | AI platform teams and developer-tool teams shipping agents that need robust tool-call parsing. |
| Value wedge | Parser/runtime/benchmark surface that improves malformed tool-call recovery. |
| Service model | Developer tooling support, integration, audit, or package sponsorship |
| Operating note | Show reliability proof first, then sell integration, custom adapters, support, or evaluation setup. |
| Best channel | Technical articles, GitHub package surface, benchmark reports, and direct platform-team outreach. |

## UX Positioning

| Moment | Design decision |
|---|---|
| First screen | State the buyer, painful workflow, proof artifact, and next action in one compact view. |
| First action | Run the smallest command or fixture that proves verify passes, then inspect the generated output or failure trace. |
| Proof moment | Show a generated artifact, benchmark, report, replay, export, or review pack before any paid ask. |
| Trust moment | Put boundaries, data policy, unsupported claims, and human-review points beside the result. |
| Conversion moment | Offer the smallest next step that matches the user's risk level. |
| Retention moment | Bring the user back with saved evidence, scorecards, review cadence, templates, or repeatable workflows. |

## Behavioral Design

| Principle | Application |
|---|---|
| Attention and working memory | Use one primary action, one visible proof artifact, and one next step so the interface does not overload attention. |
| Cognitive fluency | The first screen should answer who it is for, what pain it removes, what proof exists, and what action comes next. |
| Chunking | Break the path into inspect, try, trust, decide. Avoid making the buyer hold the whole system in working memory. |
| Salience | Show one concrete pain metric or before/after artifact instead of a broad value claim. |
| Trust calibration | State boundaries, unsupported claims, data limits, and human-review points before conversion prompts. |
| Choice architecture | Offer three clean next steps: inspect proof, run demo/check, or discuss a scoped pilot. |
| Agency | Developers should feel in control: copy commands, inspect fixtures, override defaults, and see failure states. |
| Immediate feedback | The first run should produce an artifact, trace, benchmark, or clear error within minutes. |
| Endowment effect | Let the evaluator generate a local output they can keep, compare, or paste into an internal discussion. |

## Design System Direction

- Use a docs-first surface: install, run, inspect output, compare reliability.
- Put commands, fixtures, API contracts, and failure examples above broad feature copy.
- Make the CTA a concrete developer action: run the sample, read the benchmark, request an integration audit.

## Conversion Path

- Free proof: runnable sample, benchmark, or package install.
- Paid entry: npm package support (OSS free + support) tied to one integration or reliability question.
- Expansion: Parser reliability audit ($3k-$12k audit) and Benchmark pack and integration help ($2k-$8k/month package support) after internal adoption starts.

## Scope Frame

- Price against integration time, reliability risk, maintenance burden, or evaluation coverage.
- Let open proof reduce adoption friction, then charge for adaptation, support, or governance.
- Use Tool-call recovery as the buyer-facing proof metric.

## Metrics To Watch

- Tool-call recovery
- Mutation coverage
- Integration defects avoided

## Ethical Guardrails

- No fake users, fake logos, fake financial outcomes, fake benchmarks, or unverifiable endorsements.
- No urgency timers, hidden opt-outs, forced continuity, or confusing scope.
- Conversion prompts should come after value or evidence, not before.
- Data collection should be minimal, visible, and tied to product value.
- Provider-neutral fixtures only
- Customer prompts need evals
- No universal reliability guarantee

## Next UI/UX Upgrade

- Add one above-the-fold path that leads to the first proof action.
- Add one trust panel beside the proof output, not hidden in legal text.
- Add one buyer-specific next step: diagnostic, workshop, pilot, package, support, or revival checklist.
- Remove any copy that asks for belief before showing evidence.
